#### Create email service web service

- we already created Java Mail service here: https://github.com/sample-projects-only/java_email
- Now we will convert this to Springboot web Service and test using postman. 
- for this we are creating one Spring Boot application and create service. 
- Later we will create angular service for frontend

- JSON is used for data transfer in case of web services same as xml was used before for SOAP

### Steps:

- Created empty Spring Boot application and imported in IntelliJidea
- Created controller com/email/controller/EmailApiApiService.java 

```java
package com.email.controller;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class EmailApiApiService {

    @RequestMapping (value = "/welcome")
    @ResponseBody
    public String sayHello(){
        return "Hello World Modified";
    }
}

```

- and tested it here: http://localhost:8080/welcome

```text
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/welcome'

Hello World Modified
```
- next we will create Service here: com/email/service/EmailService.java - added method from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sample-projects-only/java_email/master/src/main/java/org/nitin/App.java

- also created enitiy class here: com/email/entity/Email.java

- Now we will call EmailService in controller and pass data to it.

- ensure to enter password for sender email in service. 

- Run the Application and do POST call to Service, make sure data object is having correct mapping of variable from Email class. 

```text
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/sendemail' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "subject" : "test subject only",
     "message": "test message",
     "to" : "official.nitinjain@gmail.com",
     "sender_add" : "nitin.ibm2006@gmail.com"
}'
```

- This will send email to sender

- make sure password is specified for **sender email address** in service. 
- in case of authentication issue, one must note to ensure following settings for your gmail account:
```text
Allowing Less Secure Apps

If you have to allow an application to access your Google account, you can disable this security block.

    Sign in to Gmail
    Click here to access Less Secure App Access- https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps in My Account.
    Next to “Allow less secure apps: OFF,” select the toggle switch to turn ON.
```

- added boolean variable to service so that we can catch response if email is not sent successfully and display error.
